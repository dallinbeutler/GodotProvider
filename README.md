# Work In Progress #
I'm attempting to make a TSCN node provider to F# to allow GDScript-like native support for node paths.


This is a simple F# type provider.  It has separate design-time and runtime assemblies.





Paket is used to acquire the type provider SDK and build the nuget package (you can remove this use of paket if you like)

Building:

    .paket\paket.exe update

    dotnet build -c release

    .paket\paket.exe pack src\GodotProvider.Runtime\paket.template --version 0.0.1
